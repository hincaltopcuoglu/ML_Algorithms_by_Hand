# ML Algorithms by Hand

This repository is a collection of core machine learning algorithms implemented **from scratch in Python**. 
The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood, without relying on libraries like `scikit-learn`.

---

## 📌 Overview

- Learn how ML algorithms work by coding them manually
- Great for students, researchers, and anyone curious about ML internals
- Compare hand-crafted algorithms with scikit-learn counterparts

---

## 📁 Contents

- `Simple_Linear_Regression.py`: Manual implementation of linear regression
- `scikit_learn_works.py`: Comparison using scikit-learn
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hincaltopcuoglu/ML_Algorithms_by_Hand.git
cd ML_Algorithms_by_Hand
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Code
```bash
python Simple_Linear_Regression.py
```
